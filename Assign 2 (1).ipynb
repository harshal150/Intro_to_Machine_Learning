    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is trained too well on the training data, to the point that it becomes too specific to that data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance on both training and new data. Overfitting can be mitigated by using regularization techniques, increasing the amount of training data, or simplifying the model, while underfitting can be addressed by increasing the model's complexity or adding more features to the data."

    "\n",
    "Overfitting in machine learning can be reduced by various techniques such as regularization, increasing the size of the dataset, or simplifying the model. Regularization methods like L1 or L2 regularization can be used to penalize the model for using too many features or for large parameter values, preventing it from becoming too specific to the training data. Increasing the size of the dataset can help the model generalize better, while simplifying the model, such as reducing the number of layers or neurons in a neural network, can also reduce overfitting. Cross-validation can also be used to evaluate the model's performance on new data."

    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the tradeoff between a model's ability to fit the training data (bias) and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data (variance). A model with high bias is too simple and may underfit the data, while a model with high variance is too complex and may overfit the data.\n",

Finding the right balance between bias and variance is essential to achieving good model performance, as a model that is too simple or too complex will lead to poor generalization and performance."

    "Plot the model's performance on the training and testing data as a function of the amount of training data. If the training and testing curves converge, the model is not overfitting or underfitting. If the training curve is much better than the testing curve, the model is likely overfitting.

    "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. The penalty term is designed to discourage the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature, resulting in a more generalizable model that performs well on new, unseen data.\n",

    "L2 Regularization (Ridge): Adds a penalty term equal to the square of the coefficients, which encourages the model to have small, but non-zero coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization: Combines both L1 and L2 regularization, which balances between feature selection and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout Regularization: Randomly drops out some of the neurons during training, which helps prevent the model from relying too heavily on any one neuron.\n",
